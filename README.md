Hello techies.

This is the readme notes on this repository and it is really my first time writing a readme note.
This repository contains SQL notes that I compiled, as a guide to teach my students about SQL.
The database machine I use for compiling and teaching my students is the MySQL DBMS. 

Please, this is my personal notes which stems from years of hardwork and labour. Before using it for commercial purposes, kindly write to me for permission.

You can reach me via email address; sammysttheanalyst@gmail.com
Thank you as we grow together
